## [bankist app]

# Project Goals:

* Develop a modern banking web app with a clean and intuitive user interface.
  
* Practice DOM manipulation for dynamic updates to balances, transactions, and UI elements.
  
* Implement user login functionality with secure authentication practices (even if simulated for this project).
  
* Utilize timers in JavaScript for features like automatic logout.
  
* Employ techniques such as sorting and filtering for transaction displays.
  
# What I Learned:

*DOM Manipulation: Selecting, creating, and updating elements on the webpage for tasks like displaying transactions, user balances, and login forms.

* Event Handling: Reacting to user actions (e.g., button clicks, form submissions) and handling the corresponding UI updates and data changes.

* Data Structures: Utilizing arrays, objects, and potentially classes to represent user accounts, transaction data, and other essential app information.

* Timers: Using functions like setInterval and setTimeout to implement features like automatic logout and UI countdown displays.

* Data Manipulation: Filtering and sorting transactions based on user criteria (date, value, type).

* Basic Security Considerations (optional): Understanding principles of input sanitization and (potentially) simple password hashing techniques, even for a simulated banking app.

## Feel free to:

* Use the template as a reference for documenting your Bankist project.

* Experiment with advanced features like charts/graphs for balance visualization and loan calculation functionality.

* Share your code, questions, and any insights from building your Bankist app.
